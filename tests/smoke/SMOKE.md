# Smoke Test Review Checklist

This document provides a systematic checklist for reviewing all smoke tests in the `tests/smoke/` directory. Smoke tests focus on basic functionality, import validation, and structural correctness without making real network calls.

## Overview

Smoke tests are designed to:

- ✅ Verify basic package imports and structure
- ✅ Test class instantiation without side effects
- ✅ Validate dependency availability
- ✅ Check method existence and callable structure
- ✅ Ensure Python version compatibility

**Note**: These tests use mocking to avoid real network calls and focus purely on structural validation.

## 🎯 Review Guidelines

### For Each Test File:

1. **Structural Review**:

   - Check test organization and naming conventions
   - Verify proper use of `@pytest.mark.smoke` decorators
   - Ensure tests are focused on structure, not behavior

2. **Mocking Strategy**:

   - Validate that external dependencies are properly mocked
   - Ensure no real network calls are made
   - Check that mocks are cleaned up properly

3. **Error Handling**:

   - Verify tests fail gracefully with clear error messages
   - Check that missing dependencies are handled appropriately
   - Ensure proper exception handling in test assertions

4. **Coverage Assessment**:
   - Confirm all public API surfaces are covered
   - Verify critical dependencies are tested
   - Check that both sync and async variants are tested

### Red Flags to Watch For:

- ❌ Real network calls in smoke tests
- ❌ Missing `@pytest.mark.smoke` decorators
- ❌ Tests that depend on external services
- ❌ Overly complex logic in structural tests
- ❌ Missing cleanup or improper mocking
